**This dataset includes all major universities globally**

Each university is ranked based on a variety of different factors that include alumni employment, quality of education, quality of staff, publications, influence, citations, broad impact and an overall score by each year. This anlaysis spans from 2019-2022. 


The dataset can be found [here](https://cwur.org/2012.php). Click on the "World University Rankings" to see the rankings for each individual year starting in 2012. Each year has a differing number of rankings and a differing number of columns categorizing each institution. Each dataset was imported into microsoft excel where the data was cleaned in power query. The numbers shown in each column represents a rank from 1 to 2000, where a lower number is a higher rank unless referring to the score column where a higher number indicates a higher overall rank.
 
Questions to be answered include:

1. How do the rankings of each university compare to each other ( specifically how do the top universities change there overall rank and categorical rank over time).
2. How does my Alma Mater (McMaster University) compare to other major universities in Canada and across the globe. 
3. How do American universities on average fair in terms of their overall score relative to other developed nations (United Kingdom, Canada, Germany). How has this average changed over time.
4. How do countries outside of North America rank in terms of average score based on each category displayed in the data?
